Some words are easier to remember, such as those read to us as
children from fairy tales. Here is what passphrases look like if we
use Lang's {COLOR} Fairybooks as a corpus.  

	merry pocket six sorrow
	cunning met mill woman
	dreams gasped implored salmon
	number perhaps prepare teeth
	careful chickens escort liver
	day egg madam vexed
	christening jealous painted up
	festivities flight sometimes waiting
	back bore pierced word
	besides breath distance shepherdess
